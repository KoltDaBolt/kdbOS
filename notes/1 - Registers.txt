-=-=-=-=-= Register Sizes =-=-=-=-=-
The 64-bit registers are used for 64-bit values and are the full-size registers.
The 32-bit versions are the lower 32 bits of the 64-bit registers.
The 16-bit versions are the lower 16 bits of the 32-bit registers.
The high 8 bit registers are the upper 8 bits of the 16-bit registers.
The low 8 bit registers are the lowest 8 bits of the registers.

-=-=-=-=-= Specific Registers and Their Use =-=-=-=-=-
RAX/EAX/AX/AL/AH - are accumulator registers, traditionally used for arithmetic and I/O operations.
RBX/EBX/BX/BL/BH - are base registers, used for various purposes, especially for indexing memory or handling data.
RCX/ECX/CX/CL/CH - are count registers, often used as a loop counter in iteration and shifts/rotations.
RDX/EDX/DX/DL/DH - are data registers, used for arithmetic and I/O operations. In multiplication and division, DX often holds part of the result.
RSI/ESI/SI/SIL   - are source index registers, often used for string operations. These hold the address of the source data in operations like movsb.
RDI/EDI/DI/DIL   - are destination index registers, also used for string operations. These hold the address of the destination in operations like movsb.
RBP/EBP/BP/BPL   - are base pointer registers, often used to point to the base of the current stack frame in funcion calls.
RSP/ESP/SP/SPL   - are stack pointer registers, which point to the top of the stack. These are automatically adjusted by instructions like push, pop, call, and ret.
R8 to R15        - are additional general-purpose registers introduced in x86_64. These have 64-bit, 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit forms, but they do not have high 8-bit registers.



-=-=-=-=-= Special Purpose Registers =-=-=-=-=-
RIP    - is the instruction poniter. It holds the address of the next insturction to be executed.
RFLAGS - is the flags register, which contains various status flags that reflect the result of arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., zero flag, carry flag, overflow flag).



-=-=-=-=-= Segment Registers =-=-=-=-=-
CS (Code Segment)  - points to the segment containing the code being executed.
DS (Data Segment)  - points to the segment containing data.
SS (Stack Segment) - points to the segment containing the stack.
ES/FS/GS           - extra segment registers, occasionally used for special purposes or system-level operations.
